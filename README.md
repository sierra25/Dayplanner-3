# Dayplanner-3
Created a dynamic user interface people can use to plan out the hours in their day. The app visualizes the hours of the day via a pie chart and time block schedule board. Implemented a useful tool for calculating the hours spent on each task for user's interested in building a schedule that is correctly allocating the time available in a twenty four hour day. The schedule has add and delete functionality for each task the user inputs and lets the user know what their current sum of hours is and the hours in the day that they have remaining.
